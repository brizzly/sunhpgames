	SuperMarioHP is a new fast arcade SHAREWARE game for your HP48,49.

I need levels, I'm so busy and lazy so I build this "on-calc" fast level editor.
You may make one level or more if you want. But if you have made it, please
give me your work so I could add it in a new official release.

A level will run on a HP48G and 49G as well.


How does EDITSMHP48,EDITSMHP49 works ?
======================================
The first thing to do is a file upload from your PC to the HP:

	*If you have a 48G model select EDITSMHP48
	*If you have a 49G model select EDITSMHP49

Well, The editor is a single ready-to-use exe file.
You run it with a level file in the stack or not.


What is a SML level file ?
==========================
This is a 1280 Bytes HP string object, displayed on HP stack as:

	"SML.......0...158..ASG..[..]..."

You store it in a variable and use it with SMHP game.
Well if you want to modify a SML file you put it on
the stack and run EDITSMHP48,49 editor as:

	../SMHP/	13:56
	------------------------
	4:
	3:
	2:
	1:	"SML...........>
	[ED][L1][L2][L3][  ][  ]

What are EDITSMHP48 (SuperMarioHewlettPackardLevelEditor) KEYS ?
=====================-====-====-======-======-====-=============
>STEP1:
Use Arrows to move cursor. [G],[L] to select a surface from 13's.
You select a tile (a tile is a 8x8 level sprite) in the list with: 

	[+] key : go ahead in tile list (tile=tile+1)
	[-] key : go back in tile list (tile=tile-1)

So you have detected a very great tile, you want to draw it now!
Just push the [Y] (i.e. [+/-]) to draw the tile and write it on
your new SML level file. Repeat >STEP1 until your level is made.

Just push the [W] (i.e. [+/-]) to draw the tile and write it on
your new SML level file. Repeat >STEP2 until your level is made.


How to play it ?
================
After the hard work, we have fun!
Well if you want to play a SML file you put it on
the stack and run SMHP48,49 RAGE engine as:

	../SMHP/	21:02
	------------------------
	4:
	3:
	2:
	1:	"SML...........>
	[GA][L1][L2][L3][  ][  ]
