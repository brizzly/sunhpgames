
This is the complete source code for SuperMarioHP.

The project have been tested with MASD on YORKE.

The code is all licensed under the terms of the GPL (gnu public license).  
You should read the entire license, but the gist of it is that you can do 
anything you want with the code, including sell your new version.  The catch 
is that if you distribute new binary versions, you are required to make the 
entire source code available for free to everyone.

Our previous code releases have been under licenses that preclude 
commercial exploitation, but have no clause forcing sharing of source code.  
There have been some unfortunate losses to the community as a result of 
mod teams keeping their sources closed (and sometimes losing them).  If 
you are going to publicly release modified versions of this code, you must 
also make source code available.  I would encourage teams to even go a step 
farther and investigate using public CVS servers for development where 
possible.


All of the SMHP data files remain copyrighted and licensed under the 
original terms, so you cannot redistribute data from the original game, but if 
you do a true total conversion, you can create a standalone game based on 
this code.
